# Bastle's Castle App - An Open Source Home Automation System

## App Story
Our client, Mr. Bastle, has asked our team of developers to move his home network to the cloud, add some delightfully accomodidating application run comfortability hardware, and to do this as affordably as possible. Mr. Bastle's current system uses self directed networking hardware, and offers none of the hotel like amenities our team plans to introduce to this NEW home automations system. Further, being open source, you are able to configure and/or add to additional features you'd like in your home.

Further, and as an added service, BastlesCastle will utilize more "cognizant" data utiliztion so you no longer have to hear, "Garage doors locked," when they are already secured. Instead, BastlesCastle will reply, "your system is secure." This will aid in the amount of unnecessary data returned by devices we count on to do the work they were called upon to do. You will definately hear a failure message should that rarity occur.

Additional features and benefits will be built out as the application comes to life.
