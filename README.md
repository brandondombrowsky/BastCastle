# BastCastle Simple Home Automation using Home Assistant

## The haHA Gateway Drug
As a part of a cloud computing practicum, a team of six came together to build a home automation process using Home Assitant for three specific use cases: locks, curtains, and vents. We started testing with lights, so we kept those scipts in for funzies. Further, we built our process in the cloud but optimized it for migration to a PI-Hole. 

Take our blood, sweat, and tears and build upon this foundation. Add addtional use cases of your own. At this point, in the world of home automation IoT, the sky is the limit: lights, locks, solar panels, televisions, alarams, cameras, vents, curtains, blinds, switches, sprinklers, etc. 

WARNING: once you get started with haHA, you won't stop!
