# BastCastle Simple Home Automation using Home Assistant

## The haHA Gateway Drug
As a part of a cloud computing practicum, a team of six came together to build a home automation
process using Home Assistant for three specific use cases: locks, curtains, and vents. We started testing
with lights, so we kept those scripts in for fun. Further, we built our process in the cloud within an AWS
EC2 instance but optimized it for migration to a Pi-hole.

Take our blood, sweat, and tears and build upon this foundation. Add additional use cases of your own.
At this point, in the world of home automation IoT, the sky is the limit: lights, locks, solar panels,
televisions, alarms, cameras, vents, curtains, blinds, switches, sprinklers, etc.

WARNING: once you get started with haHA, you won't stop!
